## Plant Seeds Classification Problem
#### MD Muhaimin Rahman
In this repository, I have shown how I have used Transfer learning , to solve Plant Seeds Classification competition of Kaggle.

Here, ```PlantSeeds.ipynb``` is the explanation of codes with the codes and results. ```vgg_model_plant_seeds``` and ```xception``` folders contain  ```model_final.json``` model files of vgg and xception model respectively. ```data/test``` and ```train``` folders are test and train dataset respectively. ```Submission_Plant_Seeds_VGG.png```  is the Kaggle score of the submission using VGG19 Model and ``` Sub_xception2.png``` is the kaggle score of XCeption Model.

The example predictions,
